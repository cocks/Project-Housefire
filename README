PROJECT HOUSEFIRE
=================

This is the very early, pre-alpha "playing around" stage of /g/'s planned game -- an epic tale of cross-genre dungeon crawling. To see a complete treatment of the game, please see the page at our wiki: http://github.com/LAMMJohnson/Project-Housefire/wiki/Game-Treatment

Build Instructions
==================

The only dependency (so far) for Project Housefire is Panda3D 1.6.2 (Stable). It also has been shown to build against a newer version, but I guarantee nothing.

Panda3D might shit itself if you don't have the Python development files installed. If you get PyObject errors, this is why. "aptitude install python-dev" should fix it.

Checking out the Latest Sources
===============================

To check out the latest sources, create a clone of the github master branch on your local machine:

"git clone git://github.com/LAMMJohnson/Project-Housefire.git housefire" will create a clone of the repository located in the housefire subdirectory. Simply move to this directory and "make".

Building with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 on Windows 7
=======================================================

Download and install the following dependencies:

    * CPython 2.6 binaries: http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.6/
    * Panda 3D 1.7.0 binaries: http://www.panda3d.org/download/panda3d-1.7.0/Panda3D-1.7.0.exe

Next, set up the following system environment variables by going to Start Menu -> Control Panel -> System -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables -> New:

PYTHON_PATH should be set to the root of the directory where you installed CPython 2.6. For example, if you installed CPython 2.6 to "C:\Program Files\Python 2.6", then that should be what you set the PYTHON_PATH environment variable to.

PANDA3D_PATH should be set the root of the directory where you installed Panda3D.

Finally, open <housefire-root>\project\msvc2010\Housefire.sln in Microsoft Visual Studio 2010, and from the file menu, select Build -> Build Solution. Depending on the current configuration, the binaries should be built and placed in the <housefire-root>\bin\Debug or <housefire-root>\bin\Release directories.
