PROJECT HOUSEFIRE
=================

This is the very early, pre-alpha "playing around" stage of /g/'s planned game -- an epic tale of cross-genre dungeon crawling.

Build Instructions
==================

The only dependency (so far) for Project Housefire is Panda3D 1.6.2 (Stable). it also has been shown to build against a newer version, but I guarantee nothing.

Panda3D might shit itself if you don't have the Python development files installed. If you get PyObject errors, this is why. "aptitude install python-dev" should fix it.
